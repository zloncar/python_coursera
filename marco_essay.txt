Why Is Programming So Difficult To Learn?

Programming is often seen as an extremely difficult task and therefore people think only the extremely ***repeated word*** clever can undertake it. This is a common misconception for some, as it can be achieved with perseverance. However this does not mean that programming is a simple feat, because there are many hurdles which you have to cross. Through personal experience I have found some areas that need to be conquered before you want to become a successful programmer; patience, an eye for detail, and thinking logically ***logical thinking***.

Patience is a personal characteristic that is not exercised to its fullest, so when beginning to program it can seem very difficult. It takes time to understand difficult concepts, so you need to give up time in order to learn: consequently if you do not understand something then frustration can take over, it turn impeding your learning  ***very nice***. Being able to control frustration and be patient is a very challenging skill yet is compulsory in the world of programming.

The computer itself is not smart, but it is you who controls what it does. Because of this, the language used by the computer has to be very accurate, and when only one term is incorrect the computer will respond with 'Syntax error'. For a first time programmer this can be a difficult concept to master, and can escalate into anger quite quickly. Having this eye for detail is also a necessary skill that links in with memory; memorising these instructions/functions ***it;s called syntax*** can be annoying but being able to do it improves your eye for detail.

Computing is a completely different mindset from everyday life, because computers think ***i don't think they do***  in very ***many*** different ways. People may think that this mindset is completely unnecessary and therefore hesitate to learn programming, but this skill is still completely necessary as we cannot teach computers to think like us. This, however, does not mean that it is an easy mindset to learn. Understanding how a computer thinks is needed for learning how to write an effective program. The consequences of not knowing can be irritating as, your programs will then not follow the correct structure and may not even run correctly.

***
What about the following points:

- willinges to learn in the first place
- urge to create something new and original
- lots of asumend knowledge meens you have to learn more than just programming
- help menus overly complicated and technical
